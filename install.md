# Installing Arch Linux

The simplest way to install the base arch linux install is using the systemd package suit.
This includes systemd-boot, which will only work for UEFI systems.

Follow the arch install guide on the [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) until 3.8 or to installing the bootloader.

As mentioned before using the systemd-boot bootloader is maybe not the simplest to install, 
but for maintenance and customization (OF THE BOOT ENTRIES) systemd-boot is a good option.

This install guide is based on [this website](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/2018-05-17-how-to-configure-systemd-boot)
